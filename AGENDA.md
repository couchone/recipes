## Primary Agenda: CouchDB Recipes##

* To create a publication of Apache CouchDB cookbook recipes doing the absolute minimum (=zero) tool development i.e. no yak shaving - contribute content only.
* The goal here is to make a repository of *current* information about CouchDB available online.
* The very strong intention is to keep it updated as new versions of CouchDB are released, so that the usual "book obsolete as soon as printed" syndrome is avoided as much as possible.
* To aggressively stay electronic-only - i.e. no goal to produce a paper version of this content.  PDF versions may be available in future. 
* Stretch-Goal: To make the content available via CouchDB pull replication into a Markdown-HTML converter CouchApp so the docs are available in offline mode as well (tool building will be needed here).
* Aggressively avoid entanglement in other tool technologies such as wiki's etc although anyone interested in importing this content into wiki's is actively encouraged to do that. We avoid that here to keep aggressively prioritizing content over form.

## Secondary Agenda: CouchPub ##

To use CouchDB as part of the publication process of these tips and tricks if it adds value (individual authors push replicate content to collective repo via validation etc)  
To create workflows and templates that allow other open source projects to use CouchDB in online only publication

World Domination Agenda:  To create a new model for electronic publishing that uses CouchDB replication for authoring/publishing workflow, for downloading content for offline access, for locally indexing and searching via text search and for local enhancement and push contribution back to the collective.  We hope to catalyze and turbo boost the current glacially slow paper book publication model which is out of sync with the times.

Very rapidly the CouchPubs effort will be separated out into a separate repo so as not to distract and divert focus from the primary agenda.  Also it is likely that there may be strong interest in CouchPubs from someone who has no interest in contributing to Tips-And-Tricks and we want to actively promote and enable such a separation of concerns.
