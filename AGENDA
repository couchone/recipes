There are two agendas here :-

Primary Agenda:

To create a publication of Apache CouchDB tips and tricks doing the absolute minimum (=zero) tool development.
The goal here is to make a repository of *current* information about CouchDB available online.
The goal is to keep it updated as new versions of CouchDB are released, so that the usual "book obsolete as soon as printed" syndrome is avoided as much as possible.
To aggressively stay electronic-only - i.e. no goal to produce a paper version of this content.  PDF versions may be available in future. 

Secondary Agenda: CouchPub

To use CouchDB as part of the publication process of these tips and tricks if it adds value (individual authors push replicate content to collective repo via validation etc)  
To create workflows and templates that allow other open source projects to use CouchDB in online only publication
To make the content available via CouchDB pull replication so the docs are available in offline mode as well.

World Domination Agenda:  To create a new model for electronic publishing that uses CouchDB replication for authoring/publishing workflow, for downloading content for offline access, for locally indexing and searching via text search and for local enhancement and push contribution back to the collective.  We hope to catalyse and turbo boost the current glacially slow paper book publication model which is out of sync with the times.
